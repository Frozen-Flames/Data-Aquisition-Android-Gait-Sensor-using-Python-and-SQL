# Data-Aquisition-Android-Gait-Sensor-using-Python-and-SQL
Data acquisition is the process of measuring a real-world physical property with a sensor and storing it into a Database. The Sensor is designed to transform the magnitude of the physical property into an electrical signal that can be visualized on a computer.  The Objective of this project is to Store and analyse the IMU data Stored in SQL Database. Through this project, we aim to gather knowledge about working on similar projects and be future-ready for breakthrough technologies in our smart devices

By utilising the server that we built in Python and having stored our data in the SQL Database, and the Android application we built using Kivy we can easily send any kind of data over the server very easily which is the first application of SQL and Database in our project.

Using the client-server system we sent accelerometer and gravity sensor data from the client(android device) to the server(pc) and we were successfully able to plot the trajectory of the android phone on a 3D plot using Matplotlib Simulation Module ,and this was the second application of utilizing our data in a meaningful way where we simulated the movement of the android device and represented it on a 3-D graph.
