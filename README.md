# Data-Aquisition-Android-Gait-Sensor-using-Python-and-SQL
Data acquisition is the process of measuring a real-world physical property with a sensor and storing it into a Database. The Sensor is designed to transform the magnitude of the physical property into an electrical signal that can be visualized on a computer.  The Objective of this project is to Store and analyse the IMU data Stored in SQL Database. Through this project, we aim to gather knowledge about working on similar projects and be future-ready for breakthrough technologies in our smart devices
